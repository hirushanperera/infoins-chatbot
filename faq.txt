# INSURANCE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

## CAR INSURANCE QUESTIONS

Q: What types of car insurance do you offer?
A: We offer comprehensive car insurance including collision coverage (damage from accidents), comprehensive coverage (theft, vandalism, weather damage), liability coverage (injury/damage to others), personal injury protection (medical expenses), and uninsured motorist coverage. You can choose Basic ($50-75/month), Standard ($100-150/month), or Premium ($200-300/month) plans based on your needs and budget.

Q: How much does car insurance cost per month?
A: Car insurance costs vary based on your vehicle type, age, driving history, and coverage level. Basic plans start at $50/month for older vehicles with higher deductibles. Standard plans range from $100-150/month with balanced coverage. Premium plans cost $200-300/month and offer maximum protection with lower deductibles. Contact us for a personalized quote based on your specific situation.

Q: What factors affect my car insurance premium?
A: Your premium is determined by: driver age (under 25 pays more), driving record (accidents and violations increase rates), vehicle make and model (luxury and sports cars cost more), coverage level selected, deductible amount chosen, annual mileage, where you live (urban areas typically cost more), credit score, and whether you bundle multiple policies. Safe drivers with good credit usually get the best rates.

Q: Does car insurance cover rental cars?
A: Standard and Premium plans include rental car coverage up to $30 per day for up to 30 days while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered claim. Basic plans can add this coverage for an additional $15/month. This does not cover rental cars you rent for vacation - you may want to purchase the rental company's insurance or check if your credit card offers coverage.

Q: What should I do immediately after a car accident?
A: First, ensure everyone's safety and call 911 if anyone is injured. Move vehicles to a safe location if possible. Take photos of all damage, the accident scene, license plates, and get contact information from all drivers and witnesses. Call the police to file a report. Then contact our 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-XXX-XXXX to report the accident. Do not admit fault or sign any documents except the police report.

Q: Am I covered if someone else drives my car?
A: Yes, your insurance covers permissive users - people you give permission to drive your car. However, they must have a valid driver's license. If they have an accident, it will be claimed under YOUR policy and may affect YOUR premium at renewal time. The other driver's insurance is secondary. Make sure anyone borrowing your car is a responsible, licensed driver.

Q: What is the difference between collision and comprehensive coverage?
A: Collision coverage pays for damage to your car from accidents with other vehicles or objects (poles, trees, guardrails), regardless of who is at fault. Comprehensive coverage protects against non-collision events like theft, vandalism, fire, hail, flooding, hitting an animal, or falling objects. You need both for complete protection. If you have a car loan, your lender typically requires both types of coverage.

Q: Can I get car insurance with a bad driving record?
A: Yes, we insure drivers with accidents, speeding tickets, or DUI convictions, though premiums will be higher to reflect the increased risk. We offer accident forgiveness programs where your first at-fault accident won't increase your premium (available after 3 years of safe driving). Taking a defensive driving course can reduce your premium by 10-15%. Your rates will decrease over time as violations age off your record (typically 3-5 years).

Q: How do I add a teen driver to my policy?
A: Contact us with your teen's full name, date of birth, driver's license number, and we'll add them to your policy. Teen drivers (under 25) increase premiums significantly due to inexperience and higher accident risk. However, you can reduce costs by: having your teen maintain good grades (B average or better for a Good Student Discount), completing a driver's education course, limiting the teen to drive an older, safer vehicle, and setting a higher deductible.

Q: What is uninsured motorist coverage and do I need it?
A: Uninsured motorist coverage protects you if you're hit by a driver with no insurance or insufficient insurance. This coverage pays for your medical bills, lost wages, and vehicle damage. It's included in Standard and Premium plans and highly recommended since approximately 1 in 8 drivers are uninsured. If the at-fault driver can't pay, your uninsured motorist coverage ensures you're not left paying out of pocket.

## LAND/PROPERTY INSURANCE QUESTIONS

Q: What does land and property insurance cover?
A: Land and property insurance protects your real estate investment against damage from fire, storms, earthquakes, floods (with flood rider), theft, vandalism, and liability if someone is injured on your property. Coverage includes the land itself, permanent structures (buildings, sheds, fences), attached fixtures, and liability for injuries that occur on your property. Policies range from basic vacant land coverage ($30-50/month) to comprehensive improved property coverage ($100-300/month).

Q: How much does land insurance cost?
A: Vacant land insurance costs $30-50/month for basic coverage protecting against liability and environmental damage. Improved property with structures ranges from $100-300/month depending on property value, location, size, and coverage limits. Properties in high-risk areas (flood zones, wildfire areas, earthquake zones) cost more. Urban properties typically cost less than remote rural properties. Contact us for an accurate quote based on your specific property.

Q: Do I need insurance for vacant land?
A: Yes, even vacant land needs insurance. You're liable if someone gets injured on your property (trespasser falls in a hole, child gets hurt playing), for environmental damage (erosion affecting neighboring properties), or if someone uses your land without permission. Vacant land insurance is affordable ($30-50/month) and protects you from expensive lawsuits. If you have a loan on the land, your lender will require insurance.

Q: Does property insurance cover natural disasters?
A: Standard property insurance covers wind damage, hail, lightning, and some storm damage. However, floods and earthquakes typically require separate riders or policies. Flood insurance must be purchased separately through the National Flood Insurance Program or private insurers. Earthquake coverage is available as an add-on to your policy. If you're in a high-risk area, these additional coverages are highly recommended and may be required by lenders.

Q: What is liability coverage for property?
A: Liability coverage protects you if someone is injured on your property or if you're found legally responsible for damage to neighboring properties. This covers medical expenses for injured parties, legal defense costs if you're sued, property damage you cause to others, and court judgments against you. Coverage ranges from $100,000 to $1,000,000. This is essential protection since lawsuits can be financially devastating without insurance.

Q: Can I insure a property I'm building on?
A: Yes, we offer builder's risk insurance during construction, which then converts to standard property insurance once construction is complete. Builder's risk covers the structure during construction, materials stored on-site, and liability during the building process. Once construction is finished and you receive a certificate of occupancy, we'll convert your policy to standard property insurance. Notify us immediately when construction begins to ensure continuous coverage.

Q: What should I do if my property is damaged?
A: Contact our 24/7 claims hotline immediately at 1-800-XXX-XXXX. Document all damage with photos and videos from multiple angles. Make temporary repairs to prevent further damage (cover broken windows, tarp damaged roofs) and save all receipts - you'll be reimbursed. Don't make permanent repairs until an adjuster inspects the damage. Secure the property to prevent theft or additional damage. Do not dispose of damaged items until the claim is settled.

Q: Does insurance cover damage from tenants?
A: Standard property insurance covers damage from fire, vandalism, or natural disasters, even if caused by tenants. However, normal tenant damage (wear and tear, broken appliances from misuse) is not covered - this is considered maintenance. If you rent your property, you need a landlord policy, not a standard homeowner policy. Landlord policies cover loss of rental income if the property becomes uninhabitable and liability for tenant injuries. Require tenants to have renter's insurance for their belongings.

## CLAIMS QUESTIONS

Q: How do I file an insurance claim?
A: Call our 24/7 claims hotline at 1-800-XXX-XXXX immediately after an incident. Provide your policy number, description of what happened, and answer the agent's questions. Then submit documentation within 7 days: completed claim form, police report (if applicable), photos of damage, repair estimates, medical records (for injuries), and witness statements. Submit via online portal, email (claims@insurancecompany.com), mail, or in-person at any branch. An adjuster will contact you within 48 hours to assess the damage.

Q: How long does a claim take to process?
A: Simple claims with clear liability and straightforward damage take 1-2 weeks from filing to payment. More complex claims involving investigations, multiple parties, injuries, or disputed fault can take 30-60 days or longer. After you submit all documentation, an adjuster inspects within 48 hours. The claim decision is made within 15 business days of the inspection. Payment is processed within 5 business days of approval. You'll receive regular updates throughout the process.

Q: Will my premium increase if I file a claim?
A: It depends on several factors. At-fault accidents typically increase your premium by 20-40% at renewal. Not-at-fault accidents where another driver is responsible usually don't affect your premium. Comprehensive claims (theft, vandalism, weather) have less impact than collision claims. If you have accident forgiveness (included in Premium plan after 3 years), your first at-fault accident won't increase your rate. Small claims close to your deductible may not be worth filing since the premium increase could cost more over time.

Q: What if my claim is denied?
A: If your claim is denied, you'll receive a detailed letter explaining the specific reason (not covered under policy, policy exclusion, insufficient documentation, etc.). You have 30 days to appeal the decision. To appeal: request a detailed review, submit additional evidence or documentation, provide expert opinions or estimates, and explain why you believe the claim should be covered. If the appeal is denied, you can file a complaint with your state insurance commissioner or consult an attorney for legal options.

Q: Can I choose my own repair shop?
A: Yes, you have the right to choose any licensed repair facility for your vehicle or property repairs. We can recommend certified shops in our network that guarantee their work and offer streamlined billing, but you're not required to use them. Some repairs may require pre-approval from the adjuster. If you choose a non-network shop, get a written estimate first and submit it for approval. Keep all receipts if you pay upfront - you'll be reimbursed up to your coverage limits minus your deductible.

Q: What is a total loss and how is it determined?
A: A total loss means repair costs exceed a certain percentage of the vehicle or property's value (typically 70-75%). For example, if your car is worth $10,000 and repairs would cost $8,000, it's declared a total loss. You'll receive the actual cash value (current market value) of your vehicle/property minus your deductible. The insurance company takes possession of the totaled item. You can sometimes buy back the salvage if you want to repair it yourself, but this reduces the payout amount.

Q: Do I pay my deductible before or after repairs?
A: For repairs paid directly to a shop, the insurance company pays the shop the total cost minus your deductible, and you pay your deductible directly to the shop when you pick up your vehicle/receive services. For total loss claims or reimbursement claims, your deductible is subtracted from your insurance payment. For example, if your claim is approved for $5,000 and your deductible is $500, you receive a check for $4,500.

## PAYMENT AND BILLING QUESTIONS

Q: When is my insurance payment due?
A: Payments are due on the 1st of each month. You have a 10-day grace period (until the 10th) to make payment without penalty. If payment is received after the 10th, a $25 late fee is applied. If payment is more than 30 days late, your policy may be suspended for non-payment. To avoid late fees and suspension, we strongly recommend setting up automatic payments, which also qualifies you for a $5/month discount.

Q: What payment methods do you accept?
A: We accept multiple convenient payment options: automatic bank withdrawal (ACH) on the 1st of each month with $5/month discount, credit/debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Discover) online or by phone with no processing fee, personal checks mailed to our payment center (allow 5-7 days for processing), and cash or card at any branch location. You can pay one-time or set up recurring automatic payments for your convenience.

Q: Can I change my payment due date?
A: Yes, we can adjust your payment due date to better align with your income schedule. Common options are the 1st, 10th, 15th, or 25th of each month. Contact customer service at least 10 days before your next payment to request a due date change. There may be a pro-rated adjustment for the first payment after the change. This is especially helpful if you get paid mid-month or want to coordinate with other bills.

Q: What happens if I miss a payment?
A: If payment is not received by the 10th (end of grace period), a $25 late fee is added to your account. If payment is 30+ days late, your policy will be suspended and you'll lose coverage - this means you're driving uninsured, which is illegal and risky. To reinstate, pay all overdue amounts plus a $50 reinstatement fee. Your policy can be cancelled if payment is 60+ days late. If you're having financial difficulties, contact us immediately - we have hardship programs and payment plans available.

Q: Do you offer payment plans or financial assistance?
A: Yes, we offer several options to help customers experiencing financial hardship: extended payment plans spreading your balance over 3-6 months, temporary payment reduction for up to 3 months, deferred payments (skip a payment with approval), and military deployment payment suspension. Contact customer service before missing a payment to discuss options. We want to work with you to maintain your coverage during difficult times.

Q: Can I pay my premium annually instead of monthly?
A: Yes, you can pay your entire annual premium upfront and save approximately 8% compared to monthly payments. For example, if your monthly premium is $100 ($1,200/year), paying annually might cost $1,100 - saving you $100. Annual payment is due on your policy anniversary date. You can switch between monthly and annual payments at renewal. This option is best if you have the funds available and want to save money long-term.

## POLICY CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS

Q: How do I update my address or contact information?
A: You can update your address, phone number, or email through your online account portal (instant update), by calling customer service at 1-800-YYY-YYYY (processed immediately), or by visiting any branch location. It's important to keep this information current so you receive important policy documents, renewal notices, and can be contacted regarding claims. An address change may affect your premium if you move to a different risk area.

Q: Can I add another vehicle to my policy?
A: Yes, you can add vehicles anytime by contacting customer service with the vehicle information: make, model, year, VIN number, and purchase date. You must add a newly purchased vehicle within 30 days to maintain coverage. Adding a vehicle to your existing policy is usually cheaper than having separate policies. We'll provide you with proof of insurance immediately so you can register the vehicle. Your premium will be adjusted pro-rated from the date you add the vehicle.

Q: How do I cancel my insurance policy?
A: To cancel, provide written notice at least 30 days in advance by mail, email, or through your online portal. Include your policy number, effective cancellation date, and reason for cancellation. You may receive a pro-rated refund for unused premium minus a $50 cancellation fee. Warning: Canceling creates a coverage gap, which can significantly increase your rates when you get insurance again. If you're canceling to switch insurers, make sure your new policy is active before canceling your current one.

Q: Can I decrease my coverage to save money?
A: Yes, you can adjust your coverage levels, increase your deductibles (higher deductible = lower premium), or remove certain coverages you don't need. However, you cannot drop below your state's minimum required coverage or below what your lender requires if you have a loan. Before decreasing coverage, consider the financial risk - saving $20/month isn't worth it if you face a $50,000 lawsuit you can't cover. We can review your policy and suggest adjustments that balance cost savings with adequate protection.

Q: What is policy renewal and when does it happen?
A: Your policy automatically renews every 6 or 12 months (depending on your policy term) on your renewal date. About 30-45 days before renewal, you'll receive a renewal notice showing your new premium rate, any coverage changes, and your updated policy documents. Your premium may change based on claims filed, changes in risk factors, or overall rate adjustments. You have the right to shop around and change insurers at renewal without penalty.

## DISCOUNTS AND SAVINGS

Q: What discounts do you offer?
A: We offer multiple ways to save: Good Driver Discount (15% off for 3+ years accident-free), Multi-Policy Discount (save 15-25% by bundling auto and property), Good Student Discount (10% off for students under 25 with B average or better), Safety Features Discount (anti-theft devices, airbags, anti-lock brakes), Autopay Discount ($5/month for automatic payments), Paperless Discount ($3/month for electronic documents), Military Discount (10% for active duty and veterans), and Senior Discount (5-10% for drivers over 55). Ask about all discounts you may qualify for!

Q: How can I lower my insurance premium?
A: Several strategies can reduce your premium: increase your deductibles (raising from $500 to $1,000 can save 15-20%), improve your credit score (better credit = lower rates), take a defensive driving course (5-10% discount), remove unnecessary coverage on older vehicles, bundle policies (multi-policy discount), install safety features (anti-theft systems, dashcams), maintain continuous coverage (gaps increase rates), shop around at renewal (we'll match competitor rates), and ask about all available discounts. Review your policy annually to ensure you're getting the best rate.

Q: Do you offer safe driver rewards?
A: Yes! Our Safe Driver Program rewards accident-free driving with decreasing premiums over time. After 1 year accident-free, earn 5% discount. After 3 years, earn 15% discount plus accident forgiveness (first accident won't increase your rate). After 5 years, earn 20% discount. Additionally, Premium plan members can opt into our telematics program - install a device that monitors your driving habits (speed, braking, mileage) and earn up to 30% discount for safe driving behaviors.

Q: Can I get a discount for paying in full?
A: Yes, paying your annual premium upfront instead of monthly saves approximately 8% on your total cost. Additionally, you avoid monthly billing fees and the hassle of remembering to make 12 payments. For example, if your monthly payment is $100 ($1,200/year), paying annually might cost $1,104 instead - saving you $96. There's no penalty for switching back to monthly payments at your next renewal if you prefer.

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

Q: What is the difference between liability and full coverage?
A: Liability coverage (minimum required by law) only pays for damage and injuries you cause to others - it doesn't cover your own vehicle or medical expenses. Full coverage includes liability plus collision (covers your car in accidents) and comprehensive (covers theft, vandalism, weather damage). Full coverage protects you financially in more situations. If you have a car loan, lenders require full coverage. If your car is paid off and older, you might save money with liability-only, but you'll pay out-of-pocket for any damage to your own vehicle.

Q: How do I get proof of insurance?
A: You can get proof of insurance immediately several ways: download digital insurance cards from your online portal (accepted by DMV and police), request ID cards by phone and receive them by email within minutes, pick up printed cards at any branch location, or access them through our mobile app. Always keep proof of insurance in your vehicle - digital or paper. Some states require physical cards, while others accept digital proof on your phone. We'll mail you new cards whenever your policy renews or changes.

Q: Does insurance cover me when driving in other states?
A: Yes, your insurance coverage extends to all 50 states. Your policy meets the minimum requirements for any state you drive in. However, coverage limits don't change when you cross state lines - if you have $100,000 liability in your home state, that's what you have everywhere. If you move permanently to another state, you must update your policy within 30-60 days because premiums and requirements vary by state. Temporary travel is fully covered.

Q: What should I keep in my vehicle for emergencies?
A: Keep these items in your car: current proof of insurance (digital or printed), vehicle registration, emergency contact numbers (our 24/7 hotline: 1-800-XXX-XXXX), first aid kit, flashlight, jumper cables, basic tools, tire pressure gauge, spare tire and jack, emergency roadside kit, phone charger, pen and paper (for documenting accidents), and a camera or smartphone for photos. Consider adding road flares, blankets, water, and non-perishable snacks for longer trips or winter emergencies.

Q: How does my credit score affect my insurance rate?
A: In most states, insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores to help determine your premium. Studies show that people with better credit tend to file fewer claims. Good to excellent credit (700+) receives the best rates and can save 20-30% compared to poor credit. Fair credit (650-699) has moderate impact. Poor credit (below 650) may significantly increase your premium. To improve your rate: pay bills on time, reduce debt, check credit reports for errors, and avoid opening unnecessary new accounts. Credit is just one of many factors we consider.

Q: Can I transfer my policy to a new owner if I sell my vehicle/property?
A: No, insurance policies are not transferable to new owners. When you sell your vehicle or property, you should cancel your policy and receive a pro-rated refund for unused premium. The new owner must obtain their own insurance policy. However, if you're buying another vehicle/property, we can easily transfer your existing policy to the new asset without a lapse in coverage - just notify us within 30 days of the purchase with the new vehicle/property details.
