# COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE POLICY MANUAL

## SECTION 1: COVERAGE DETAILS

### What Your Policy Covers

Your insurance policy is designed to protect you financially from unexpected events. Coverage is divided into three main categories:

**Property Damage Coverage**
Protects your vehicle or property against physical damage from accidents, natural disasters, theft, vandalism, and fire. This includes the actual structure of your vehicle or property, as well as permanent fixtures. Coverage limits range from $50,000 (Basic) to $500,000 (Premium) depending on your selected plan.

**Liability Coverage**
Protects you if you're found legally responsible for injury to another person or damage to their property. This covers medical expenses, legal fees, and property repairs for the other party. Minimum coverage is $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident (Basic plan), with Premium plans offering up to $1,000,000 in total liability protection.

**Personal Injury Protection**
Covers medical expenses, lost wages, and rehabilitation costs for you and your passengers, regardless of who is at fault. This includes hospital bills, ambulance fees, physical therapy, and even funeral expenses if needed. Coverage ranges from $10,000 to $100,000 depending on your plan tier.

## SECTION 2: CLAIMS PROCESS (STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE)

2. Document the scene - take photos from multiple angles showing all damage, license plates, and surroundings
3. Collect information - get names, phone numbers, insurance info, and statements from all parties involved
4. File a police report if the incident involves another vehicle, injury, or significant damage
5. DO NOT admit fault or sign any documents (except for police reports)

**Call our 24/7 Claims Hotline: 1-800-XXX-XXXX**
Available anytime, day or night, including holidays. Our agents will guide you through the initial report and answer immediate questions.

The inspection typically takes 30-60 minutes. You can have a representative present if desired.

## SECTION 4: POLICY MODIFICATIONS

### How to Change Your Policy

**What You Can Modify:**
- Coverage limits (increase or decrease)
- Deductible amounts
- Add or remove drivers
- Add or remove vehicles/properties
- Change coverage types (add comprehensive, remove collision, etc.)
- Update personal information (address, phone, email)

**Process for Making Changes:**
1. Contact us at least 30 days before your renewal date for changes to take effect at renewal
2. For immediate changes (adding a driver after purchase of new vehicle), contact us within 7 days
3. Request changes via phone (1-800-YYY-YYYY), online portal, or in-person at any branch

**How Changes Affect Your Premium:**
- Increasing coverage = higher premium
- Raising deductibles = lower premium
- Adding young drivers (under 25) = higher premium
- Adding experienced drivers (25+, clean record) = minimal increase
- Removing coverage = lower premium (but less protection)

### Adding or Removing Drivers

**To Add a Driver:**
- Provide full legal name, date of birth, driver's license number
- Submit driving record (we can obtain with consent)
- Must be licensed in your state
- Drivers under 25 or with accidents/violations will increase premium

**To Remove a Driver:**
- Provide written notice with driver's name and effective date
- Must confirm driver no longer has access to insured vehicle
- Premium adjusted at next billing cycle

**Excluded Drivers:**
If someone in your household should not drive your vehicle (suspended license, high risk), you must formally exclude them. This means the policy will NOT cover any incidents if that person drives your vehicle.

### Changing Coverage Levels

**When to Consider Increasing Coverage:**
- Purchased a new, more expensive vehicle
- Property value has increased
- You want more protection and peace of mind
- Required by lender (for financed vehicles/properties)

**When You Might Decrease Coverage:**
- Vehicle is older and worth less
- You own the vehicle outright (no loan)
- Willing to accept more financial risk
- Need to reduce monthly expenses

**Important:** Never drop coverage below your state's minimum requirements or lender requirements if you have a loan.

## SECTION 5: DEDUCTIBLES EXPLAINED

### What is a Deductible?

A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before your insurance coverage begins. For example, if you have $10,000 in damage and a $1,000 deductible, you pay $1,000 and insurance pays $9,000.

### Standard Deductible Amounts

**Property Damage:**
- $500 (Standard/Premium plans)
- $1,000 (Basic plan)
- $1,500 (Budget option with lower premiums)

**Collision:**
- $250 (Premium plan)
- $500 (Standard plan)
- $1,000 (Basic plan)

**Comprehensive:**
- $250 (all plans)
- $0 (glass-only claims - windshield replacement)

### How Deductibles Work in Real Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Minor Accident**
- Damage to your vehicle: $2,500
- Your deductible: $500
- You pay: $500
- Insurance pays: $2,000

**Scenario 2: Total Loss**
- Vehicle value: $25,000
- Your deductible: $1,000
- You pay: $1,000 deductible
- Insurance pays: $24,000

**Scenario 3: Damage Below Deductible**
- Minor scratch repair: $400
- Your deductible: $500
- You pay: $400 (entire amount - doesn't meet deductible)
- Insurance pays: $0
- **Tip:** Don't file a claim for damage less than your deductible - you'll pay it all anyway and it may increase your premium.

### Choosing the Right Deductible

**Higher Deductible = Lower Premium**
- Choose if: You have emergency savings, want lower monthly costs, have a safe driving record
- Risk: You'll pay more out-of-pocket if you have a claim

**Lower Deductible = Higher Premium**
- Choose if: You prefer peace of mind, don't have large emergency savings, want less financial stress if something happens
- Benefit: Less money needed upfront during a claim

## SECTION 6: EXCLUSIONS (WHAT'S NOT COVERED)

### Understanding Policy Exclusions

These situations are NOT covered by your insurance policy. Claims related to these will be denied:

**Intentional Damage**
Any damage you cause on purpose, including vandalism of your own property, fraudulent claims, or staged accidents. This is illegal and may result in policy cancellation and criminal charges.

**Normal Wear and Tear**
- Engine problems from age or lack of maintenance
- Rust, corrosion, or deterioration over time
- Tire wear from regular use
- Fading paint or interior damage from sun exposure
- Mechanical breakdowns (consider extended warranty separately)

**Excluded Drivers**
If someone drives your vehicle who is specifically excluded on your policy (named exclusion), any damage or liability from that incident is NOT covered. This includes household members you've formally excluded.

**Driving Under the Influence (DUI/DWI)**
Any accident or damage that occurs while you or another driver is:
- Intoxicated (blood alcohol content above legal limit)
- Under the influence of illegal drugs
- Impaired by prescription medications against medical advice

**Commercial Use of Personal Vehicle**
Your personal auto policy does not cover:
- Rideshare driving (Uber, Lyft) - requires separate rideshare coverage
- Delivery services (food delivery, packages)
- Transporting goods for business purposes
- Using vehicle as a taxi or for-hire service

**Additional Exclusions:**
- Racing or competitive driving events
- Damage from nuclear hazards or war
- Property seizure by government

## SECTION 8: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Does my insurance follow me or my vehicle?**
A: Your insurance primarily covers your vehicle, but you have limited coverage when driving other vehicles with permission. Check your policy for "permissive use" details.

**Q: Am I covered if I lend my car to a friend?**
A: Yes, your insurance covers permissive users (people you allow to drive), but if they have an accident, it will be filed under YOUR policy and may affect YOUR premium. Make sure the driver has a valid license.

**Q: What happens if I'm in an accident with an uninsured driver?**
A: If you have uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage (included in Standard and Premium plans), your policy will cover your damages up to your policy limits.

**Q: Will filing a claim increase my premium?**
A: It depends on the circumstances. At-fault accidents typically increase premiums at renewal. Not-at-fault accidents may not affect your premium. Small claims may not be worth filing if they're close to your deductible.

**Q: How long does it take to process a claim?**
A: Simple claims can be processed in 1-2 weeks. Complex claims involving investigations, multiple parties, or injuries may take 30-60 days or longer.

**Q: Can I cancel my policy anytime?**
A: Yes, but you must provide 30 days written notice. You may receive a prorated refund for unused premium, minus any cancellation fees. Canceling may result in higher rates when you get insurance again due to a coverage gap.
